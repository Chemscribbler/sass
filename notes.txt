Steps:

Create a VM instance- Ubuntu is easy to work with
SSH connect
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python, pip, and postgres
install venv and do everything in that venv, it will make your life easier

actual requirements at the time being:
    networkx
    sqlalchemy
    flask
    flask_login* (not implemented but called iirc)
    configparser
    markup
    pg8000
    sqlparse
    gunicorn

Copy over files (currently using WinSCP) that run the server

Follow these instructions for setting up the Postgres DB
https://cloud.google.com/community/tutorials/setting-up-postgres

Create the starting tables (can use PG4Admin or terminal, postgres.sql is the correct setup for now)

all python things are under ~/.local/bin/APP_NAME so to run them you need to use that as the path
So to start the server using gunicorn use:
 ~/.local/bin/gunicorn -b :8080 main:app
 This makes it web accessible without anyone having to enter the port
 sudo home/pruyn/venv/bin/gunicorn -b :80 main:app

 Make sure to update the config.ini to the correct username and password for the database



Attempted to follow this to get the url working, but I suspect I need to do some port forwarding etc
